What am I going to create?

I've always wanted to create a community for computer science students where they can share interesting things they are working on/ any new skills/technologies they learned.

However, due to time constainsts I will begin this project with just a blog application where I can upload
walkthrough tutorials on different computer science projects.

Why is this useful?
This website can help students espace the tutorial purgatory and guide them on building intersting portfolio projects
